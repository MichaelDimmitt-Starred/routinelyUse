These programs are placed here for the explicit purpose of my getting them to run in an elixir environment and creating a collection of the programs I appreciate.

Code for The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook
========================================

Welcome! This is the source code for "The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook".

## Running the code

For programs that are not created by `mix`, can be run as such:

```
% iex length_converter.ex
```

Larger programs such as `metex` in Chapter 3, can be run with the following command:

```
% iex -S mix
```

These larger programs will contain their own READMEs and more detailed instructions on running the program.

Enjoy!
