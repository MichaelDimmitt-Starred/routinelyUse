I do not hold the rights to the information presented. 
These programs are placed here for the explicit purpose of my getting them to run in an elixir environment and creating a collection of the programs I appreciate.

These are the examples accompanying the [Elixir in Action](http://www.manning.com/juric/) book.
To run these examples you need to have Elixir 1.0, Erlang 17, and a git client installed on your system.
The examples can also be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/sasa1977/elixir-in-action).
